# Authentication Module - Transcendence Backend

## Overview

This module implements user management and authentication for the Transcendence backend.

The authentication system uses:

- NestJS
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- JWT (JSON Web Token)
- Passport
- bcrypt password hashing

The objective is to allow users to register, authenticate, and access protected API routes using JWT tokens.

---

# Features

## User Management

Implemented:

- Create users
- List users
- Store user data in PostgreSQL
- Validate incoming data using DTOs
- Hash passwords before storing them

User fields:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "pedro",
  "email": "pedro@test.com",
  "password": "$2b$10$...",
  "wallet": 10000,
  "avatar": null,
  "wins": 0,
  "losses": 0,
  "createdAt": "2026-07-18T14:15:50.101Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-18T14:15:50.101Z"
}
```

# Authentication Flow

The authentication process works as follows:

```
Register User
      |
      v
Password Hashing (bcrypt)
      |
      v
Save User in PostgreSQL


Login
      |
      v
Find User by Email
      |
      v
Compare Password Hash
      |
      v
Generate JWT Token
      |
      v
Access Protected Routes
```

---

# Dependencies

Installed packages:

```bash
npm install @nestjs/jwt @nestjs/passport passport passport-jwt bcrypt
```

Development dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D @types/passport-jwt @types/bcrypt
```

# API Endpoints

## Create User

### Request

```
POST /users
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "username":"pedro",
  "email":"pedro@test.com",
  "password":"12345678",
  "wallet":10000
}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id":4,
  "username":"pedro",
  "email":"pedro@test.com",
  "wallet":10000
}
```

The password is stored encrypted using bcrypt.

---

# Login

## Request

```
POST /auth/login
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email":"pedro@test.com",
  "password":"12345678"
}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni..."
}
```

The token must be used to access protected routes.

> **Confirms the field used by the per-account rate limiter**: the Redis
> key built in `AuthService.login()` for brute-force protection is keyed on
> this `email` field (`login_attempts:${dto.email}`) — see
> `RATE_LIMITING.md` / `AUTH_HARDENING_REPORT.md` for the full rate limiting
> design built on top of this endpoint.

---

# Protected Routes

Routes protected by JWT require:

```
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/users \
-H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni..."
```

Without a token:

Response:

```json
{
  "message":"Unauthorized",
  "statusCode":401
}
```

---

# JWT Guard

Protected controllers use:

```typescript
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
@Get()
findAll() {
  return this.usersService.findAll();
}
```

The guard verifies:

1. JWT exists
2. Signature is valid
3. Token is not expired

---

# Password Security

Passwords are never stored in plain text.

Before saving:

```typescript
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
```

During login:

```typescript
bcrypt.compare(password, hash)
```

Example:

Original:

```
12345678
```

Stored:

```
$2b$10$dH2XGNhLh3knvnz0YtFMf...
```

---

# Docker

The backend runs inside Docker:

```
backend
 |
 |-- NestJS
 |
 |-- Prisma
 |
 |-- PostgreSQL
```

Build:

```bash
docker compose build backend
```

Start:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check logs:

```bash
docker logs backend
```

---

# Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/appdb
```

**`JWT_SECRET` is no longer stored in `.env` or passed as an environment
variable to the `backend` container.** It was migrated to HashiCorp Vault
(secret `secret/jwt`), fetched over an AppRole login during the backend's
bootstrap phase (`main.ts`, before `NestFactory.create()` runs), and kept
only in the running Node process's memory —
`docker compose exec backend env | grep JWT_SECRET` returns nothing by
design. See `AUTH_HARDENING_REPORT.md` §3 and `SECURITY_REPORT.md` §3 for
the full migration, including a real ordering bug found and fixed along the
way (the module that used the secret was being evaluated before Vault had
responded).

`JWT_EXPIRES` (token lifetime) is unaffected by this and, if still used,
remains a plain environment variable — it isn't a secret.

# Testing Authentication

## 1. Create account

```bash
POST /users
```

## 2. Login

```bash
POST /auth/login
```

Copy:

```
access_token
```

## 3. Access protected routes

```bash
GET /users
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN
```

---

# Future Improvements

Planned:

* ~~Move JWT secret to Hashicorp Vault~~ — **done**, see "Environment
  Variables" above.
* Refresh tokens
* Logout / token invalidation
* Role based authorization — **partially implemented**: the forum's
  moderation endpoints already use `RolesGuard`/`@Roles` to restrict
  access (e.g. resolving reports, viewing moderation logs). Not yet a
  general-purpose role system applied across every module.
* Two-factor authentication
* Hide password field from API responses
* Add email verification
